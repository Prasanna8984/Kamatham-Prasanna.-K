# RAG Chatbot

This project is a basic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model AI chatbot using Java for 

the backend and HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend. The embeddings are stored in a vector 

database.

## Features

- Upload documents or text files for training the RAG model.

- Simple chat interface for interacting with the chatbot.

## Requirements

- Java 11+

- Maven

- Node.js

- Python (for generating embeddings)

- Vector Database (Zilliz/Supabase)

- Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:

 sh

 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rag-chatbot.git

 cd rag-chatbot

 

2. Install dependencies:

 sh

 mvn install

 

3. Run the backend server:

 sh

 mvn spring-boot:run

 

4. Open `index.html` in your browser to access the frontend.

Conclusion

This guide provides a basic framework for building a RAG model AI chatbot with Java backend 

and a simple frontend. The focus is on the integration of a vector database for storing 

embeddings and handling user queries using prompt engineering. Ensure to add detailed logic for 

embedding generation and retrieval according to the specific vector database and embedding 

model you choose to use.
